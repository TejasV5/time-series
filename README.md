Time series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMAX

Time Series Analysis using ARIMA and SARIMAX
This project focuses on analyzing time series data and making predictions using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The workflow includes extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and time series decomposition.

Description
The Time Series Analysis project aims to analyze and forecast time-dependent data using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The dataset includes a time series of champaign sales, and the goal is to build accurate models for predicting future sales values. The project encompasses various stages building a model to making predictions and evaluating model performance.

Skills Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Time Series Models:
ARIMA: Building and tuning AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models.
SARIMAX: Implementing Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE , MAE, MSE MAPE.
Data Visualization: Creating comprehensive visualizations to understand data and model results.
Predictions: Making future forecasts based on the trained models.
Time Series Decomposition: Breaking down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
